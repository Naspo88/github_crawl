# ABOUT
This project use Github's API to search for a user a show his repositories.
The application have a simple UX/UI design to give priority to app functionality.

There is a header with the title of the application and above a single centered search form. Sending to the form it will search first for the user and in case he will be find (and he have some public repositories), the application download and show his respositories.
Clicking on the name of the user you'll be linked to guithub user profile.

When we have find all datas the application will show some profile datas on the left of the screen anche a paginated list (5 for page) of repositories on the right. 
Every repository is shown with a little header with the name and above the will be a little coloum where we can find some important stats about the repository and the full description. Clicking on the name you'll be linked to github repository view.

At the bottom there is the pagination link to view every pages of the list, above the list there is the filtering and sorting options. I choose to filter by the repository's name by a search text input and to give the possibility to sort the list by every option shown in the repository element in both order we want.

# Getting started
I choose to use cdn links to import all dependencies, as I need only few files to run my project. So getting the application is ready to be used.

# Used Tech
- Angular.js - JS framework
- Bootstrap - CSS framework
- jQuery - to mansge DOM element

# What missing
I can work on the project only after my work hour for 2-3 hours for evening so I try to build the most important specs for the project. With more time would be for sure interessing to build more type of filters and sorts element to permit user to view what more he need.
Could be interessing to show more infos about user like followers and following under the other elements.
There will be more infos to view for repositories too.

I would loved to manage more the UX/UI of the application to give user a better service and to perform some automated tests.
