# ABOUT
This project uses Github's API to search for a user and show his/her repositories. The application has a simple UX/UI design to give priority to the app's functionality.

There is a header with the title of the application and above a single centered search form.
By submitting the form, the app will be searching for the user - and if the user has any public repositores, these will be shown as a list. Clicking on the name of the user will redirect to the Github user profile.

When the data is fetched - the application will show some profile data on the left of the screen and a paginated list (5 for page) of repositories on the right. Each repository is shown with a header with the name and above there will be a little coloum where we can find some important stats about the repository and the full description. Clicking on the name will redirect to the github's repository page.

At the bottom there is the pagination links, and above the list there is the filtering and sorting options. I chose to filter by the repository's name, by a search text input and to give the possibility to sort the list by every option shown in the repository element in both order we want.

# Getting started
I choose to use cdn links to import all dependencies, as I need only few files to run my project. So the application is ready to be used.

# Used Tech
- Angular.js - JS framework
- Bootstrap - CSS framework
- jQuery - to manage DOM element

# What missing
I could work on the project only after my work hour for a few hours - so I tried to build the most important specs for the project. With more time would be for sure interessing to build more types of filters and sorting element to permit the user to view more info. Could be interesting to show more info about the user's followers and following.

I would have loved to manage more the UX/UI of the application to give user a better service and to perform some automated tests.
